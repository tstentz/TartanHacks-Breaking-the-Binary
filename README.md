# TartanHacks-Breaking-the-Binary
# Inspiration
Created by Tiffany Jiang, Nikhil Choudhary, Tara Stentz, and Melody Ting at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy for the university  wide annual hackathon. The team was inspired to take action against the thousands of unreported cases of sexual assault against both women and men that take place on American campuses every year and worked together for 24 hours to create Ping, a bystander empowering and sexual assault prevention app. Comparable to a "slack" application for bystanders and witnesses of sexual assault, Ping connects you to a peer SSN (Student Support Network) mentor in times of need for advice on how to diffuse or get out of situations involving suspicious behavior.

#Prototype
The app was prototyped in Illustrator and Photoshop and developed in Ionic frameworks to support mobile development. It features the Facebook API, messaging capacities, geolocation and a map, as well as a directory and anonymous chat space to connect with SSN members who can provide support, advice, and aid if needed.
